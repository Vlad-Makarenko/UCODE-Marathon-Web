                        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                        passages, and more recently with desktop publishing

                        distracted by the readable content of a page when
                        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                        here', making it look like readable English. </td>

                        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                        still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                        over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                        purpose (injected humour and the like). </td>
