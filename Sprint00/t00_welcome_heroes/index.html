            <p>superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability
                to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
                So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more
                    exceptional than any power a normal human being could
                    possess</b>,
                and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
                Otherwise,
                a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>For
                instance, a good guy fighting
                a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective
                story or human-interest story.
                But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad
                guy, it becomes a superhero story.
                If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
                couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish,
                then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
